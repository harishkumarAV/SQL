# SQL

Welcome to my SQL repository! Here, I track my progress as I learn structured query language and database management.
In the past year, I've focused on mastering SQL, solving over 250 challenges on platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode.
This repository is my journal of daily progress, insights, and the problems I tackle.
From basic queries to advanced optimization techniques, I'm committed to continual learning in SQL.
Expect updates on the problems I solve, new concepts I learn, and any milestones I achieve.
Whether you're an SQL enthusiast or just curious about databases, feel free to explore and join me on this learning journey!
Have a nice day:)
